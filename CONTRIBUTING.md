# Claiming Issues & Asking Questions

New to open source? Here's how to get started the right way:

* **Comment before you start.** Find an issue you want to work on, leave a comment like *"Hi, I'd like to work on this!"*, and wait to be assigned before writing any code.
* **Don't open a PR for an unassigned issue.** It may be closed without review.
* **Ask questions early.** If something in the issue is unclear, ask in the comments — don't guess.
* **Communicate if you're stuck.** If you can't finish an issue, let the maintainer know so someone else can pick it up.
* **One issue at a time.** Finish and submit your current work before claiming another issue.
